                        <p>ARTENO limits itself to collect information in order to ensure accurate service. Most of the
                            information we collect is very basic and is needed to complete a purchase or provide a
                            refund. Examples of customer information that may be collected by us include your name,
                            address, telephone number, date of birth, email address, descriptions of the items requested
                            or purchased, language preference, the IP address and operating system of your computer, and
                            the browser type and version being used by you. We will not sell, distribute or lease your
                            personal information to third parties.</p>

                        <p>We may automatically track certain information about you based upon your behavior on our
                            site. We use this information to do internal research on our users&#39; demographics,
                            interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve our users. This information
                            is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis and individual information is not
                            identifiable. Credit Card, Debit Card and Banking Information:&lt;&gt; </p>

                        <p>ARTENO does not collect or store Credit Card or Debit Card or any of your banking information
                            as it is directly transmitted through the payment gateway provider to the payment network or
                            bank.</p>

                        <h2>2. REGISTRATION</h2>

                        <p>Your password is a component of our security system. As such, it is your responsibility to
                            protect it. Do not share your password with any third parties. If your password has been
                            compromised for any reason, you should change it immediately or contact us for the same.</p>
